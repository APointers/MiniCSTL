We often want to have a set of stls when developing in C like in C++,
but we can't find a good general, modular, weakly dependent data structure for C implementations on the Internet. 
After preparing for a while, referencing many peer implementations, I'm ready to collect my own set of C STLs. 
The content of this repository is in accordance with the open source software license, 
including some other people's implementation and my own implementation or transformation, 
if infringement, please contact me, email 308021782@qq.com. 
Welcome more peers to participate!
